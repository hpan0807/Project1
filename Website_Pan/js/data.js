    "The Elmhurst Artists’ Guild Spring Member’s Show features a variety of work made by regional artists in several media. The breadth of style and media includes watercolor, ceramics, oil, acrylic, digital, collage, photographic and sculptural works. The many emerging artists from the Chicagoland area created landscapes, portraits, abstractions and other styles. The inspiration for each artist is as diverse as the spectrum of media employed. <br><br>This show presents an opportunity to meet the artists and learn first-hand about their work. An added bonus is that all purchases provide support to the artists, Guild, and Elmhurst Art Museum.",
    "The Elmhurst Artists’ Guild (“EAG”) presents MoDa: Mother and Daughter Exhibit Together, solo and collaborative original artwork by Terri Shimkus and her daughter, Danielle Hepko. For Shimkis, EAG Board Member and Communications Chair, collaborating on this exhibition with her 27-year-old daughter is a dream come true as they have created artwork together since Hepko was a child. Cassie Swierenga, EAG President, said the show “provides a rare opportunity to view the artistic influences a mother has passed onto a child.”<br><br><br><br><br><br>",
    "Local artist and educator Donna Castellanos collects and transforms everyday objects--which she calls “once loved things”--into a bold hands-on exhibit. Castellanos imagined each separate museum space as if it was a room in a house such as a study, playroom, dressing room, or workshop. Each thematic gallery then has an autobiographical element, whether through materials important to her or narratives that evoke her past. Throughout the exhibition, visitors encounter worn and well-loved items that share a commonality, from repurposed encyclopedias to antique musical instruments. Both nostalgia and inclusion are strong motifs as guests are invited to add their own contributions to her personalized installations. <br><br> Many of the exhibition materials were sourced from estate sales and thrift stores. Reusing these castoff items, Castellanos incorporates them into a variety of mixed media from painting, sculpture, installation, wearable jewelry, and clothing. She then invites gallery visitors to reconsider items that can be easily discarded, especially when viewers are encouraged to become active participants by playing, creating, and performing. Castellanos gives these “once loved things” a second life by inventing a new outlet for a visitor’s engagement and an exploration of their own creativity.<br><br>Donna Castellanos has been in the Elmhurst community since she was born, and now gives back to the community as an artist, curator, and educator. As the Elmhurst Art Museum’s Education Program Coordinator, she teaches a variety of classes and designs interactive interpretive displays for each of the major exhibitions. Since 2013 she has been the art director and curator for Flight 112, a local bar, restaurant and gallery in Elmhurst. Castellanos received a degree in graphic design from the American Academy of Art in Chicago.",
    "Elmhurst Art Museum presents the world premiere of Chicago-based artist David Wallace Haskins’ Skycube outside the Museum beginning August 11, 2015. A three-ton construction of steel, glass and far infrared light film, Haskins’ 8 x 8 x 8 foot Skycube brings the full vertical dimension of the sky down to the pictorial plane. Seen at eye level through a square aperture cut into the white steel cube, the moving image of the sky is not a digital projection or display—it is the actual three-dimensional sky. Bridging sculpture, architecture and painting, Skycube is the first public exhibition of Haskins’ groundbreaking work.<br><br>During the day, atmospheric changes move across the Skycube’s exterior aperture like a living painting continually recreating itself. Walking up to the opening reveals an interior 8 x 8 foot wall appearing as an immersive three-dimensional mural of the sky. In the evening, the Skycube moves through endless hues of blue until a deep black square emerges, slowly revealing a composition of moving stars and planets.<br><br>Elmhurst Art Museum’s presentation of Skycube will run through the spring of 2016, when a solo exhibition of Haskins’ poetic and interactive work will open at the Museum.<br><br>An Elmhurst native, artist David Wallace Haskins conducts experiments and explorations with light, space, time and sound. While working with experts in psychology, ecology, physics and philosophy, Haskins leads a core team of likeminded artists and technicians to develop and evolve these experiments into innovative installations, sculptures and events.
